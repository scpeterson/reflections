When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work locally?
So you can share with a team of developers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
So you can control the process and make certain you are always accessing working code.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks are a copy of another repository that is separate, but retains the knowledge of the original, parent repository.  You use this if you want to contribute to a project but have no rights to teh original repository.
Clones are exact copies of a repository.  You can use a clone to get a repository onto your local computer from a remote repository, but in this case you have rights to the remote repository and you will be pushing changes to it.
Branches are a part of a repository and allow you to explore alternatives without affecting the master branch.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
So you know how far ahead or behind you are from the remote.
